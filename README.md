# Luhn Tester

Tests whether a credit card number is valid according to the [Luhn test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

This is a little project I put together in order to complete a "Coding Coach" challenge in the [SoloLearn app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn&hl=en_US).
